# 📘 Forecast Academy — Documentation Home

Welcome to the documentation hub for Real-World Forecasting Foundations, the hands-on companion to Forecast Academy’s flagship course.

This section contains all the non-notebook learning materials:
dataset guides, diagrams, visual references, strategic frameworks, and supporting explanations to complement the coding exercises.

If the notebooks are the classroom, this folder is the textbook.

## 📚 What You’ll Find Here

This documentation includes:

- Deep explanations of the M5 dataset

- Forecasting frameworks used throughout the course

- Visual reference guides

- Glossaries & cheat sheets

- Links to course artifacts

These materials are designed to help you understand not just how to forecast, but why forecasting systems work the way they do.

## 🧭 How to Use This Documentation

The content here is lightweight by design.
Use it when you need:

- a reminder of a concept covered earlier

- clarity on dataset fields

- visual reference for EDA patterns

- help understanding a strategy diagram

- context behind what a notebook is doing

Each notebook links back to the relevant page in docs/ so you never have to guess where to find explanations.

## ✨ About This Course

Real-World Forecasting Foundations is built around one goal:

Teach forecasting the way it is actually practiced inside world-class organizations.

This means:

- Clean timelines

- Preventing leakage

_ Diagnostics at scale

_ Interpreting patterns
